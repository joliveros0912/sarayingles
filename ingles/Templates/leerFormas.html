            <strong>The Shapes Play in the Park</strong><br><br>
            Circle rolled happily. Square walked firmly. Triangle hopped happily. Rectangle slid smoothly. 
            They were friends and loved to play in the Shapes Park.<br><br>
            In the park, they saw Oval and Star. They played hide-and-seek behind the round trees and built a tall tower with the square blocks. 
            Triangle climbed a pointy slide. Rectangle found a long swing.<br><br>
            Even though they were different, they had a lot of fun together. 
            Circle rolled fast, Square made strong bases, Triangle pointed high, and Rectangle was long. 
            Being different made them a great team!
