        <h2>The Mysterious House</h2>
        <p>
            On top of a hill, there stood an old and mysterious house. 
            Its windows looked like eyes that watched everything around it. 
            Upon entering, the first thing you saw was a large living room, with a fireplace where the fire always burned.
            To the right was the kitchen, where delicious cakes and hot soups were prepared.
            Going up the stairs, you reached the bedrooms, where the beds invited you to dream.
            At the end of the hall was the bathroom, with a large bathtub full of bubbles.
            And outside, surrounding the house, was a beautiful garden, full of flowers of all colors and a swing that swayed with the wind.
