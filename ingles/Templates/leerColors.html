            <h3>The Little Rainbow</h3>
            <p>
                Drop was a raindrop in a gray world. One day, the sun shone on her, and poof! She became a little rainbow. She had bright colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet.<br><br>
                Rainbow hopped and touched the gray things. And color appeared! The trees were green, the flowers red and yellow, the houses blue. Everyone was happy with the new colors.<br><br>
                Rainbow played all day. In the end, her colors faded, and she became Drop again. But the world was no longer gray, it was full of color thanks to her visit!
